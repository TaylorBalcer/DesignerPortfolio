                <!-- <section class="main_content"> -->
                   
                   
                    <p class="case_study_p">Hi everyone. This is Taylor. I thought I'd
                        give you some insight into the problem-solving process I use when I approach a project,
                        by sharing with you how I developed this very site. The task I faced was to create a brand and portfolio website to showcase my web design skills and let potential clients get into contact with me.</p>
            
                
           
                <p class="content__bold2">1. Ideate</p>
                <img src="../img/sketches.jpg" alt="logo sketches" class="my-pic3"></figure>
                <p> In the Ideation phase I get to turn my imagination loose, exploring various possibilities for planning for the logo, color scheme, text and how the pages would be structured. The tools I used to refine my ideas in this case
                    included sketching and styled wireframes. I sketched some ideas for my personal idenity logo, then I had the difficult task of choosing one to bring to life with Adobe Illustrator. After getting some opinions from colleagues in industryI chose the perfect logo for me, then re-created and colorized my logo in Illustrator. Once the logo was finished, I carefully and consistenley incorporated it into promotional materials, such as my resume, business card, etc. After finalization, I then created some stylized wireframes which helped me start creating the structure of my portfolio website with HTML/CSS. 
                  
                  
                  </p>
                
        
                <p class="content__bold2">2. Prototype</p>
                <img src="../img/logowork.jpg" alt="Working on a logo" class="my-pic3"></figure>
                <p>Prototypes of my logo, resume, reference page, business card and  portfolio website were created so that I could have some memebers of my target audience try it out and
                    give me their impressions.</p>
        
                <p class="content__bold2">3. Test</p>
                <img src="../img/websitework.jpeg" alt="Working on the website" class="my-pic3"></figure>
                <p>I prompted various target users to test the website. I had them narrate
                    their interaction with it, which allowed me to identify items needing to be corrected in order for the app to better function. </p>
                <p>Testing revealed that I should make the following improvements:</p>
              <ul>
                    <li>Use better placement and spacing of text on the About pagepage for both desktop and mobile</p>
                    <li>Improve the text color to be more readable</p>
                    <li>Find better ways to showcase extra images without taking too much space, instead of just providing a link to an image/pdf.</p>
                    </ul>
                <!-- <p class="content__bold2">Overview</p>
                            
                <p>The task I faced was to create a portfolio website to showcase Taylor's web design skills and let potential clients get into contact with me.
                I started with sketching a few ideas for my personal identity logo, then created and finalized a logo that best fit my personality and style. I then created a designed reference page, resume and business card where I then implemented my logo and color scheme.
                Once I finalized these documents, I then started to create a few different stylized wireframes for my portfolio website.
                After selecting a design I then created the structure of the portfolio webpage using HTML/CSS.
                I then implemented the same color scheme and design elements that was displayed on my logo, resume, business card, etc., and included screenshots of my past works. </p>  -->
