                <p class="case_study_p">Hi everyone. This is Taylor. I thought I'd
                    give you some insight into the problem-solving process I use when I approach a project,
                    by sharing with you how I developed this very site.</p>
        
            
       
            <p class="content__bold2">1. Ideate</p>
            <img src="../img/sketches.jpg" alt="logo sketches" class="my-pic3"></figure>
            <p> In the Ideation phase I get to turn my imagination loose, exploring various possibilities for planning for the logo, color scheme, text and how the pages would be structured. The tools I used to refine my ideas
                included sketching, creating a designed resume, reference page, business card, and styled wireframes. I sketched some ideas for my personal idenity logo, then I had the difficult task of choosing one to bring to life with Adobe Illustrator. After I chose the perfect logo for me, I re-created and colorized my logo in Illustrator. I consistenly improved documents such as my resume, business card, etc. After finalization, I then created some stylized wireframes which helped me start creating the structure of my portfolio website with HTML/CSS.</p>
            
    
            <p class="content__bold2">2. Prototype</p>
            <img src="../img/logowork.jpg" alt="Working on a logo" class="my-pic3"></figure>
            <p>A prototype of my logo, resume, reference page, business card and my portfolio website was created so that I could have some memebers of my target audience try it out and
                give me their impressions.</p>
    
            <p class="content__bold2">3. Test</p>
            <img src="../img/websitework.jpeg" alt="Working on the website" class="my-pic3"></figure>
            <p>I prompted various target users to test the website. I had them narrate
                their intraction with it, which allowed me to identify items needing to be corrected in order for the app to better function. </p>
            <p>Testing revealed that I should make the following improvements:</p>
          <ul>
                <li>Use Better placement and spacing of text on About page's desktop and mobile</p>
                <li>Improve text color to be more readable</p>
                <li>Find better ways to showcase extra images without taking too much space, instead of just providing a link to an image/pdf.</p>
                </ul>
            <p class="content__bold2">Overview</p>
                        
            <p>The task I faced was to create a portfolio website to showcase Taylor's web design skills and let potential clients get into contact with me.
            I started with sketching a few ideas for my personal identity logo, then created and finalized a logo that best fit my personality and style. I then created a designed reference page, resume and business card where I then implemented my logo and color scheme.
            Once I finalized these documents, I then started to create a few different stylized wireframes for my portfolio website.
            After selecting a design I then created the structure of the portfolio webpage using HTML/CSS.
            I then implemented the same color scheme and design elements that was displayed on my logo, resume, business card, etc., and included screenshots of my past works. </p>
