        <!-- <section class="main_content"> -->


        <p class="case_study_p">Hi everyone. This is Taylor. I thought I'd
          give you some insight into the problem-solving process I use when I approach a project,
          by sharing with you how I developed this very site. The task I faced was to create a brand and portfolio
          website to showcase my web design skills and let potential clients get into contact with me.</p>



        <p class="content__bold2">1. Ideate</p>
        <img src="../img/sketches.jpg" alt="logo sketches" class="my-pic3"></figure>
        <p> In the Ideation phase I get to turn my imagination loose, exploring various possibilities for
          the logo, color scheme, text and how the pages would be structured. The tools I used to refine my ideas in
          this case
          included sketching and styled wireframes. I sketched some ideas for my personal idenity logo, then I had the
          difficult task of choosing one to bring to life with Adobe Illustrator. After getting some opinions from
          colleagues in industry I chose the perfect logo for me, then re-created and colorized my logo in Illustrator.
          Once the logo was finished, I carefully and consistentley incorporated it into promotional materials, such as
          my resume, business card, etc. I then created some stylized wireframes which helped me
          start creating the structure of my portfolio website with HTML/CSS. I also repeated elements taken from my designed resume such as a gold strip and shades of purple.


        </p>


        <p class="content__bold2">2. Prototype</p>
        <img src="../img/logowork.jpg"  alt="Working on a logo" class="my-pic3"></figure>
        <p style="padding-bottom:.75rem;">Prototypes of my logo, resume, reference page, business card and portfolio website were created so that I
          could have some members of my target audience try it out and
          give me their impressions.</p>

        <p class="content__bold2">3. Test</p>
        <img src="../img/websitework.jpeg" alt="Working on the website" class="my-pic3"></figure>
        <p style="padding-bottom:.75rem;">I prompted various target users to test the website. I had them narrate
          their interaction with it, which allowed me to identify items needing to be corrected in order for the app to
          better function. </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom:.75rem;">Testing revealed that I should make the following improvements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use better placement and spacing of text on the About page for both desktop and mobile</p>
          <li>Improve the text color to be more readable</p>
          <li>Find better ways to showcase extra images without taking too much space, instead of just providing a link
            to an image/pdf.</p>
        </ul>
        <p class="content__bold2">Overview</p>
                            
        <p style="padding-bottom:.75rem;">In the end, the process of brainstorming many solutions, sketching, wireframing, prototyping and testing helped guarantee an effective new brand and website. I use a similar approach when doing work for clients. </p>
